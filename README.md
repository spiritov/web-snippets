### [tf2 rocket & sticky moving background](https://spiritov.github.io/web-snippets/jumple%20active%20background/index.html)
originally created for [jumple](https://github.com/spiritov/jumple), but included here to make it easy to use in other projects.

### [tf2 jump / general tournament overlay helper](https://spiritov.github.io/web-snippets/tournament-overlay-helper/src/generate.html)
generates a webpage intended to be used for a stream overlay as a browser source. URL must be re-copied as a tournament progresses, since it utilizes URL query parameters. You can interact with the OBS source -> click score boxes if other elements on the page don't need to be changed between URL updates.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> deprecated, a reworked version supporting automatic updates is [available here!](https://github.com/spiritov/jump-tourney-overlay?tab=readme-ov-file)
