[tf2 jump / general speedrunning tournament overlay helper](https://spiritov.github.io/web-snippets/tournament-overlay-helper/src/generate.html)
> generates a webpage intended to be used for a stream overlay as a browser source. URL must be re-copied as a tournament progresses, since it utilizes URL query parameters. You can interact with the OBS source -> click score boxes if other elements on the page don't need to be changed. See [this alternate version](https://spiritov.github.io/web-snippets/onlyobs-tournament-overlay-helper/src/generate.html) to update it live, but it requires using the "generate" page as another browser source in OBS, moving it offscreen on stream preview, and interacting with it.
