[tf2 jump / general speedrunning tournament overlay helper](https://spiritov.github.io/web-snippets/tournament-overlay-helper/src/generate.html)
> generates a webpage intended to be used as a stream overlay as a browser source. URL must be re-copied as a tournament progresses, since this is only a static site utilizing URL query parameters. However, you can click / interact with the score if other elements on the page don't need to be changed.
